## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Overview**

This project is an **educational web application** that blends **storytelling, vocabulary learning, interactive assessments, and community-driven content creation** for children aged 4–10.
It follows a **mobile-first Progressive Web App** approach, enabling **offline-first functionality** and **low-bandwidth optimization**, ensuring access in rural or under-connected areas.

The app supports **multi-language content**, culturally relevant stories, and integrates **ethical social storytelling campaigns** to connect learning with real-life values.
It also includes **adaptive learning**, **accessibility-first design**, and **low-data features** so children of all backgrounds can participate.

---

## **2. Target Audience**

- Children aged 4–10 who consume and interact with stories

**Secondary Users:**

- Parents tracking child progress
- Teachers integrating app stories into lessons

**Contributors:**

- Story Writers, Narrators, Illustrators, Translators, Reviewers, Moderators
- Community educators and NGOs collaborating for local content

---

## **3. Goals & Objectives**

1. Deliver **engaging stories** in audio, illustrated, and lightweight animated formats
2. Build **vocabulary skills** with interactive word tracking
3. Provide **quizzes and gamified activities** to boost retention
4. Foster a **safe, inclusive community of contributors** for diverse content
5. Ensure **seamless offline use** for low-connectivity regions
6. Enable **safe, ethical sharing** of children’s progress
7. Support **inclusive learning modes** (sign language, dyslexia-friendly, bilingual)
8. Establish **content quality standards** through contributor training & review
